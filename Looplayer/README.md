Looplayer
=========

A full-screen, auto-running media player for Android.

## Purpose

This app was created for an artistic exhibition for which artists needed to display a looping video from a beamer.

To achieve this, we got our hands on some Android-based media player sticks, but couldn't find a decent, simple and free app to do the job. So I wrote it.

## Features

Looplayer makes any Android device a pure media player, perfectly suited for exhibitions and performances.

Its main features are:
- Displays fullscreen media, nothing more.
- Supports playlists of videos and pictures.
- Easy to configure.
- Auto-runs at device startup.

## Configuration

All the configuration can be done from a file explorer.

1. Put the videos and pictures you want to display in your Movies folder. (Only in the root of Movies! Sub-folders of Movies are ignored!)
2. Rename the files. Looplayer will play them in alphabetical order.
3. Pictures are displayed for 15 seconds. To change this, rename the picture file and add how much time you want it to be displayed. E.g. "pic.jpg" becomes "pic 35s.jpg" and will be displayed for 35 seconds. If you want the picture to be displayed for ever, add 0s. E.g. "pic 0s.jpg".
